The author wrote this book for the Social Science Education Consortium which is
a non-profit educational organization in social science existing from 1963. The
book is created for classroom use, and includes instructions for use intended
for teachers. It contains very useful information gathered from different
sources. It gets deeper into some of the actions that caused the Revolution.
Personally, I like the fact that both American and British thinking are
presented in the book.
