Colonial and British forces fought the Battle of Cowpens, at Hannah's Cowpens,
South Carolina, as a late battle in the Southern Campaign of the American
Revolution on January 17, 1781. At the end of \red{Lt. Col Banastre Tarleton's}
pursuit, \red{Brig. Gen Daniel Morgan} chose Hannah's Cowpens as the
battlefield to halt Tarleton and his streak of victories. Ultimately, this
turned the tide of the war.

This paper describes the Battle of Cowpens. First we will discuss our sources, followed
by the campaign, the battle itsself, and its ultimate significance.
