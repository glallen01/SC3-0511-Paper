% Rise of Liberalism and Republicanism
% 
% As tensions regarding colonial lands and taxation increased during the 1760s
% and 1770s, many American leaders were influenced by the liberal and republican
% ideals espoused by Enlightenment writers such as John Locke. Key among Locke's
% theories was that of the ``social contract'' which stated that legitimate state
% authority must be derived from the consent of the governed. Also, that should
% the government abuse the rights of the governed, it was the natural
% responsibility of the people to rise up and overthrow their leaders. The ideas
% of Locke and other similar writers contributed to the American embrace of
% ``republican'' ideology in the years before the Revolution. Standing in
% opposition to tyrants, republicanism called for the protection liberty through
% the rule of law and civic virtue.
