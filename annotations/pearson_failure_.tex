The author was U.S. Army Major at the time he finished this paper. This was his
paper for a master degree in Military History. It is approved for public
release and unlimited distribution. I have used just the information on page 16
that explicitly shows to the readers the confrontation among the
representatives in the upper house of the British Parliament related to the war
in America.
