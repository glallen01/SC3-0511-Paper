The author was teaching History at the University of Alabama. Iâ€™ve read just the chapter 3 of this book that contains information about the British and American forces in the Revolutionary War that I found very useful. Although the book is about the Southern Campaign of the Revolutionary War, this chapter provides the reader information about the forces used during the war. It is focused on description of the human forces.
