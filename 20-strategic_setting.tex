  What do we mean by the Revolution? The war? That was no part of the Revolution;
  it was only an effect and consequence of it. The Revolution was in the minds of
  the people, and this was effected, from 1760 to 1775, in the course of
  fifteen years before a drop of blood was shed at Lexington. The records of
  thriteen legislatures, the pamphlets, newspapers in all the colonies, ought
  to be consulted during that period to ascertain the steps by which the public
  opinion was enlightened and informed concerning the authority of Parliament
  over the colonies.\footnote{John Adams to Jefferson, 1815}

\paragraph{British}

Strategic Objectives: ``maintain the thirteen colonies as a British possession''\footcite[2]{moncure_cowpens_1996}

``British military objectives were fourfold: separate the New England colonies from th eothers by seizing the Hudson River north to Lake Champlain; isolate the ''bread basket`` colonies of Pennsylvania and Maryland; control the southern populace by holding Charleston, Georgetown, and the line of the Santee River; and, finally, blockade the entire American coast to prevent an influx of arms from abroad.''\footcite[2]{moncure_cowpens_1996}

Strategic Strategies: ``divide the Colonies by applying economic sanctions to the most rebellious''\footcite[2]{moncure_cowpens_1996}

Other British National objectives: other colonies, West Indies, trade routes, (discuss mercentilism?), 

``\ldots d'Estaing's presence in the Caribbean together with a Spanish fleet in Havana (after Spain's entry on the American side in June 1779) forced Clinton to send 8,000 troops to the West Indes. These transfers weakened Clinton so severely that he never seriously challenged Washington's position at West Point, New York.''\footcite[10]{moncure_cowpens_1996}
