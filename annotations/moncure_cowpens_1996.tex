Moncure was a professor of military history at Davidson College, and also is a
European historian who holds a M.A. and Ph.D. in Modern European History from
Cornell University. Moncure's book was good in the sense that it gave different
perspective of the battles in forms of  letters from different individuals,
from privates to great leaders.

This handbook was a useful resource; breaking the battle down with maps of each
phase of combat and providing detailed analysis of the courses of action taken
by the commanders.

The author is a former US Army officer who holds an M.A. and PhD in Modern
European History from Cornell University.  This publication approaches the
Battle of Cowpens from the perspective of using both the text and location as
ground for a Staff Ride.  The collection of letters and personal histories in
the back of the book serve as an invaluable tool in analyzing the participants
emotions and recollections of the Battle.
