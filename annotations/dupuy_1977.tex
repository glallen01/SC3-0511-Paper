This book was written by three authors to explore the history of the war of
1775-1783 as a `World War' and a continuation of the Seven Years' War, or the
`Great War for the Empire.' Dupuy was a retired Army Colonel and military
historian, Hammerman a European history writer, and Hayes a Naval military
historian. This book is useful for explaining the trade interactions between the
Colonies and other nations prior to the Revolution, and the conflicts between
Britain and other foreign powers during the Revolution. It is recommended as an
alternate perspective, and a little studied analysis of the international
affects of the American Revolution.
