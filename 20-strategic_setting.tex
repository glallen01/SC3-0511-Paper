  What do we mean by the Revolution? The war? That was no part of the Revolution;
  it was only an effect and consequence of it. The Revolution was in the minds of
  the people, and this was effected, from 1760 to 1775, in the course of
  fifteen years before a drop of blood was shed at Lexington. The records of
  thriteen legislatures, the pamphlets, newspapers in all the colonies, ought
  to be consulted during that period to ascertain the steps by which the public
  opinion was enlightened and informed concerning the authority of Parliament
  over the colonies.\footnote{John Adams to Jefferson, 1815}

\subsection{Mercantilism}

\subsection{--notes--: Cook}

King George III ascended to the throne in 1760. He succeeded two German
speaking kings, and was the first native-born soverign over England in
\red{???} years. Along with these other differences, he was at odds with the
Whig party which has previously driven politics and policy in England for
\red{??? years}. His transition was three years prior to the end of the Seven
years war, which ran from \red{???} to 1763. And, although crowned following a
series of victores, George III's first proclamation as ruler reflected his
desire to end the war, rebuild a war-burdened economy and country that had
already reached it's highest level of debit so far.
