Russel F. Weigley is a professor of history at Temple University in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The book is relatively unbiased. The book was
extremely useful in determining neutrals and partisans in the operational
situation section and includes a brief discussion of tactics. I highly recommend
this source.
