\subsection{Causes of the Conflict}

%\subsubsection{--text--}

There are many factors of politics, trade, economics and policy that all
affected the colonies break away from Britain One analysis of the American
Revolution sees it as a continuation of the Seven Years War. Another focuses on
its nature as a revolt against tightening of mercantilism around the colonies,
who were slowly gravitating towards idas of trade codified by Adam Smith's
``wealth of Nations,'' published in \red{1776}. The popular analysis lies in a
revolt against laws seen as unjust, levied without representatoin. This section
will address in turn the previous war, mercantilism, the influence of other
foreign powers, and finally the series of political events that drew a line in
the sand for the colonies.

\red{The American Revolution, from the international standpoint, was one in a series
of conflicts between Europe's major powers that also took part in America.
Britain and France had already been at war off an on for \red{????} years before
the Revolution, both in Europe and in France. }

The political and economic origins of the American revolution are tied to King
George III's resentment of the Whig parliment that had ruled England during the
reign of his father and grandfather. George III came to the throne as a native
Brit, rather than a German import, and rather than allowing parliment and the
Prime Minister to govern, he was determined to replace the Whigs with Loyalists
and restore power to the throne. The political maneuvering of his followers,
the leadership of William Pitt, the popular Whig secretary of state and
victorious strategist of the Seven Years War, and the `salutary
neglect'  policies of his predecessor Sir Robert Walpole, Prime Minister under
King George the I.\cite[Ch 1-4]{cook_long_1995}

Walpole ``took the enlightened view that if the colonies were left to run their
own local affairs with minimal interference from London, they owuld produce more
wealth and commerce, prosper, and give less trouble.''\cite[p. 3]{cook_long_1995}

In 1756, Frederick II, the Great, of Prussia conducted a pre-emptive invasion 
of Saxony. He had been allied against by Austria, France, Russia, Sweden and
Saxony, and a defensive alliance with Britain alone. With this attack Frederick
``succeeded only in solidifying the coalition against
him,''\cite{dupuy_1977} and drew Britain as an ally into a general conflict
between European powers where it would seek and achieve several strategic
gains.

Britain routed the French in Canada, India, several Carribean 
islands,\footnote{``In the Caribbean, British forces captured two French
islands valuable for their sugar, Guadeloupe and Martinique, territories
considered by many more crucial to the French Empire than all of vast, vacant 
Canada. They also took Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and 
Dominica.''\cite[8]{dupuy_1977}} Gor\'ee, France's chief slave-trading center
in Western Africa, as well as Gibraltar and Minorca.\cite[7-9]{dupuy_1977}
From Spain, Britain seized Havana, Manila and the Philippines. Ultimately the
Prussians were saved by the favor of Peter III when he succeeded Empress
Elizabeth to the throne of Russia in 1762, rather than by the British, despite
their support. As Dupuy el al describe, the European land campaigns of the
Seven Years' War, fought over dynastic aims, had little lasting impact.
However, the naval and foreign campaigns fought between Britain and France over
empire and mercantileism, reshaped the sea-lanes in Britain's favor. In the
Treaty of Paris France lost Canada and all land East of the Missippi
River.\cite[10]{dupuy_1977}

  `John Adams felt strongly that Americans tended to confuse the American 
  Revolution with the Revolutionary War. The war, he wrote to Thomas Jefferson,
  ``was no part of the Revolution. It was only an effect and consequence of it.''
  Adams, well aware that he was presenting and unconventional view, went on to
  state that the Revolution had taken place in the minds of the people from 1760
  to 1775, ``before a drop of blood was spilled at
  Lexington.'''\cite[15]{dupuy_1977}

The War of Grand Alliance and King Williams War 

In the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748) Britain and Austria allied against
France, Spain and others, while in the Americas, Britan's colonies fought the
French and Indians in King George's War (1744-1748) \footnote{Rickard, J. (22

``George III was twenty-two years old when he began a history-laden reign that
would last for sixty years. He was headstrong and obstinate, full of youthful
prejudices, lacking in humility, wisdom, or vision, with little interest in the
opinions of others. But he was also hardworking, prudish, religious, and moral.
He came to the throne determined not merely to reign but to rule. To do so, he
would have to bring his own Loyalists to power and open a new political era
after a half century of dominance by the Whigs. He judged that England was
war-weary and overburdened with debt. He wanted peace, and he took no great
pride in Pitt's faraway victories in the American colonies or other parts of the
globe. American trade was booming, there were no signs of trouble, and all
seemed well.'' \cite[p. 5]{cook_long_1995}

  ``They, planted by your care? No! Your oppression planted 'Em in America,
  They fled your tyranny to an uncultivated an dunhospitable country where they
  exposed themselves to almost all the hardships to which human nature is
  liable, and among others to the cruelty of a Savage foe. And yet, actuated by
  the Principles of English Liberty, they met all these hardships with pleasure,
  compared with those they suffered in their own Country, from the hands of
  those who should have been their friends.''

  ``They, nourished by your Indulgence? They grew up by your neglect of 'Em; as
  soon as you began to care about 'Em---sent to spy ou their Liberty, to
  misrepresent their Actions, to prey on 'Em.''

  ``They, protected by your Arms? They have nobly taken up Arms in your defense,
  have exerted a valour against their consent and Laborious industry for the
  defense of a Country whose frontiers, while drenched in blood, its interior
  Parts have yielded all its little Savings to your Emolument. And believe me,
  and remember I this day told you so, that some spirit of Freedom which
  actuated the at people at first will acompany them still\ldots
  
  ''I claim to know more of America that most of you, having seen and been

  What do we mean by the Revolution? The war? That was no part of the Revolution;
  it was only an effect and consequence of it. The Revolution was in the minds of
  the people, and this was effected, from 1760 to 1775, in the course of
  fifteen years before a drop of blood was shed at Lexington. The records of
  thriteen legislatures, the pamphlets, newspapers in all the colonies, ought
  to be consulted during that period to ascertain the steps by which the public
  opinion was enlightened and informed concerning the authority of Parliament
  over the colonies.\footnote{John Adams to Jefferson, 1815}

\subsection{Mercantilism}

\subsection{--notes--: Cook}

King George III ascended to the throne in 1760. He succeeded two German
speaking kings, and was the first native-born soverign over England in
\red{???} years. Along with these other differences, he was at odds with the
Whig party which has previously driven politics and policy in England for
\red{??? years}. His transition was three years prior to the end of the Seven
years war, which ran from \red{???} to 1763. And, although crowned following a
series of victores, George III's first proclamation as ruler reflected his
desire to end the war, rebuild a war-burdened economy and country that had
already reached it's highest level of debit so far.
