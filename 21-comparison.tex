\subsubsection{National (Strategic) objectives}

\index{Strategic Objectives}

\paragraph{British}

Strategic Objectives: ``maintain the thirteen colonies as a British possession''\footcite[2]{moncure_cowpens_1996}

``British military objectives were fourfold: separate the New England colonies from th eothers by seizing the Hudson River north to Lake Champlain; isolate the ''bread basket`` colonies of Pennsylvania and Maryland; control the southern populace by holding Charleston, Georgetown, and the line of the Santee River; and, finally, blockade the entire American coast to prevent an influx of arms from abroad.''\footcite[2]{moncure_cowpens_1996}

Strategic Strategies: ``divide the Colonies by applying economic sanctions to the most rebellious''\footcite[2]{moncure_cowpens_1996}

Other British National objectives: other colonies, West Indies, trade routes, (discuss mercentilism?), 

``\ldots d'Estaing's presence in the Caribbean together with a Spanish fleet in Havana (after Spain's entry on the American side in June 1779) forced Clinton to send 8,000 troops to the West Indes. These transfers weakened Clinton so severely that he never seriously challenged Washington's position at West Point, New York.''\footcite[10]{moncure_cowpens_1996}
