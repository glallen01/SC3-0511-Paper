The author was a professor of American History and director of the Clements
Library at the University of Michigan. The book is a review of the wars that
were fought on the territory of USA before the Revolutionary War. It reviews
the four major wars in the period from 1689 to 1762, but I have used it just
for the information on page 1 that in the period between 1607 and 1689 the war
was limited to fighting against the Indians without involving the Great
European powers.
