Cook served as a foreign correspondent for the LA Times and New York Herald
Tribune for forty years, and served for ten years in London prior to writing this
book. To balance the typical American focus on the war, Cook portrays detailed
accounts of the actions and perspectives of King George III, Parliment and the
British political apparatus during the Revolutionary Era, and their interactions
with the Colonies. He includes both arguments and counter arguments made in
Britain that led to their actions, illustrated by primary source quotations.
This book provided source material for the lead up to the war, and is highly
recommended for anyone seeking a political understanding of the British side of
the Revolution.
