As a wikipedia article, this page has been revised by several authors and
sourced from other material. Sourcing the Chart, it's factual nature does not
lend itself to POV or bias. This, as with all all Wikipedia references, is a
starting point for research, and the chart borrowed from this page was rebuilt
with information from Berard, pp. 98-111. I recommend Wikipedia in
general for background research in order to find additional topics or sources,
but not as a definitive source.
