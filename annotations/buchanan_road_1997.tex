The author is a popular historian who was an archivist at Cornell University and
The Metropolitan Museum of Art.  This is a traditional historical book which
contains a good description of the Battle of Cowpens.  The target audience for
this read is anyone interested in an in-depth read into the tactical
descriptions of battle in North and South Carolina. It is an excellent campaign
account of the Carolinas from 1780-81. It is also recommended for anyone seeking
a larger understanding of British actions in the Carolinas during the
Revolutionary War period.
