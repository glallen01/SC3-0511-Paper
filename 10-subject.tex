Colonial and British forces fought the Battle of Cowpens, at Hannah's Cowpens,
South Carolina, as a late battle in the Southern Campaign of the American
Revolution on January 17, 1781. At the end of Lt. Col Banastre Tarleton's
pursuit, Brig. Gen Daniel Morgan chose Hannah's Cowpens as the
battlefield to halt Tarleton and his streak of victories. Ultimately, this
turned the tide of the war.

This paper describes the Battle of Cowpens. First we will discuss our sources,
followed by the campaign, the battle, and its ultimate significance.

%\subsection{Discussion of Sources}

  % \begin{singlespace}
  % \red{\small\emph{(1) What are the sources of information concerning the battle?\\
  % (2) What types of sources are required for a thorough, balanced account of the fight?\\
  % (Biographies, operational histories, battle journals, after-action reports, war diaries, etc.)}}

Several sources of information are available for the study of Cowpens. These
include historical works, writings and memoirs from primary sources, maps, state
and national park service documents and the battlefield terrain itself, still
preserved as the Cowpens' National Battlefield near Chesnee, SC. Since some
writers will focus on specific aspects of the battle, or on either the British
or Colonial forces, the variety of sources we pull from provides balance in our
analysis. Below is a listing of each reference used in our battle analysis,
with specific analysis towards each author's background, perspective, focus and
finally our recommendations towards use of each source.
