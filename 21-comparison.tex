\subsubsection{National (Strategic) objectives}

\index{Strategic Objectives}

\paragraph{British}

Strategic Objectives: ``maintain the thirteen colonies as a British
possession''\cite[2]{moncure_cowpens_1996}

``British military objectives were fourfold: separate the New England colonies
from the others by seizing the Hudson River north to Lake Champlain; isolate the
'bread basket' colonies of Pennsylvania and Maryland; control the southern
populace by holding Charleston, Georgetown, and the line of the Santee River;
and, finally, blockade the entire American coast to prevent an influx of arms
from abroad.''\cite[2]{moncure_cowpens_1996}

Strategic Strategies: ``divide the Colonies by applying economic sanctions to
the most rebellious''\cite[2]{moncure_cowpens_1996}

%Other British National objectives: other colonies, West Indies, trade routes,
%(discuss mercantilism?), 

%``\ldots d'Estaing's presence in the Caribbean together with a Spanish fleet in
%Havana (after Spain's entry on the American side in June 1779) forced Clinton to
%send 8,000 troops to the West Indies. These transfers weakened Clinton so
%severely that he never seriously challenged Washington's position at West Point,
%New York.''\footcite[10]{moncure_cowpens_1996} \index{d'Estaing}
