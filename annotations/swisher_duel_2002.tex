The author holds a masterâ€™s degree in history from the University of Virginia,
Charlottesville and received the Jefferson Davis Medal and the Virginia State
Library Book of the Year Award in 2000. The target audience for this read is
an individual seeking a brief overview of the Battle of Cowpens. It should
probably not be used as a reference for actual analysis on the battle.
