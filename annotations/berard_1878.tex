Berard was a historian in the late 19th century, who wrote textbooks for both
education and educators. She wrote at least four textbooks in the 1870s on
American and British history targeted to children, grade school and `Normal
School,' students, equivalent to students at a teachers' college today. She is
also listed on several documents related to West Point. As an example, she wrote
the obituary for a for a Lt. Harrington killed in Little Big Horn for the report
for the \emph{Eigth Annual Reunion of the Association of Graduates of the US Military
Academy\ldots June 14, 1877}. Other works of hers imply a congressional
commission for their writing, although there is very little information
information on her personally as an author outside of her book introductions and
bylines. The target audience of this book was normal school instructors and
students, who would proceed to teach grade school history. It is written as a
programmed instruction, in the form of an extended outline. This book is
recommended as a concise and thorough outline of events of American history. For
this analysis it was sourced for information on the Intercolonial wars and for
timelines.
