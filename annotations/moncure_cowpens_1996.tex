Moncure was a professor of military history at Davidson College, and also is a
European historian who holds a M.A. and Ph.D. in Modern European History from
Cornell University. Moncureâ€™s book was good in the sense that it gave different
perspective of the battles in forms of  letters from different individuals,
from privates to great leaders.

This handbook was a useful resource; breaking the battle down with maps of each
phase of combat and providing detailed analysis of the courses of action taken
by the commanders.
