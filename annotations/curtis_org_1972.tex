Originally this text was a doctoral dissertation presented to Yale University in
1916. The book is an analysis of additional factors to British defeat, as Curtis
contends that inept leaders were by no means the decisive factor. Just as
important were the general administrative corruption and logistical problems
within the British Army. It is recommended for overall understanding of the
British Army's readiness, order of battle and administration.
